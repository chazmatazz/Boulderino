Boulderino is a fancy breadboard that allows the use of 3-wire (signal, VCC, GND) cables and 2 wire motor cables 
(A,B) to interface with the Pololu Baby Orangutan, which is usable with the Arduino library. The jacks accept 
VEX keyed connectors. There is a 4P4C modular jack. 

See http://blog.charlesdietrich.com/2012/02/introducing-coloradouino.html for a description of the design process.
